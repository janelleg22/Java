Make sure to test each function by invoking(calling) it in the init() function

Problem 1:

For example: adjective = "loud", noun = "person" and verb = "runs".
The function returns the string "The loud person runs".

String madlib("person", "loud",  "runs");
System.out.println("madlib results: " + madlib);
