Challenge 2:
Write a function "FtoC" that converts temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. The function will take in temperature in Fahrenheit and return the temperature in Celcius. (Search up the formula)
Ask the user for their temperature in Fahrenheit, use the function by calling it and print the result returned from the function to the console. 

   



Challenge 3:
Write a function "sphereVolume" that calculate the volume of a sphere. The function will take in the radius and return the volume of a sphere. (Search up the formula)
Ask the user for the radius, use the function by calling it and print the result returned from the function to the console.
   

Challenge 4:
Write a function "coneVolume" that calculate the volume of a cone. The function will take in the radius and a height and return the volume of a cone. (Search up the formula)
Ask the user for the radius and the height, use the function by calling it and print the resulted return from the function to the console.
   

Challenge 5:
Write a function "distance" that calculate the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The function will need to take paramaters that represents two points. (Search up the formula)
Ask the user for the first and second coordinates, use the function by calling it and print the resulted return from the function to the console.
